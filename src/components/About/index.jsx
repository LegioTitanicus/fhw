					Sight Saving Academy of India (SSAI), founded in 2004, has
					historically served to fill gaps in healthcare access for
					populations most in need of support. Established in the New
					York Metropolitan area, SSAI identified a much-needed
					service to support local healthcare professionals and
					struggling businesses as the coronavirus outbreak worsened.
					On March 25, 2020, SSAI changed its bylaws to serve as the
					umbrella nonprofit for this effort.{" "}

						Our goal is to support local business while providing
